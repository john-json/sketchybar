## Features
* Full *configurability* at any time
* Dynamic *animation* system
* Powerful *scripting* and *event* system
* Optimized to be *fast* and *efficient*
* Interactive *mouse* support
* Support for displaying macOS menu bar apps (*aliases*)
* Can draw arbitrary *graphs*
* On-demand *popup* menus

The main design principle of this project is that *all* elements of the bar can
be added, removed and freely changed at any point in time. Thus, the
configuration of the bar is not *static*, rather it is possible to adapt the
appearance of the bar completely dynamically with the help of a powerful
event-driven scripting system at any point in time using the highly
configurable basic building blocks SketchyBar offers.

## Getting Started
Refer to the installation guide in the [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/setup) to get the program set up.
Once this is sorted you can start to become familiar with the syntax of sketchybar by going through the default [*sketchybarrc*](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/blob/master/sketchybarrc) file and the default [*plugin scripts*](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/blob/master/plugins),
which are located in `~/.config/sketchybar/` and look like this:

All commands and options are explained in detail in the relevant sections
of the configuration [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/bar). You can try the commands directly from
the commandline to see which affect they have and how they alter the bar. Once you have become familiar with the syntax you can
look for a config to start from [here](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47?sort=top) or start from scratch and customize
everything to your liking.

You might also enjoy looking at the [Tips & Tricks](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/tricks) section
for some further tips on your journey. If you are searching for functional items you might want to check the
[plugins](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12?sort=top) section if someone has already created what you are looking for.

Should you encounter things not working as you expect them to, please *do not* hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/issues), as
this is either a bug or a documentation problem and relevant in any case.

## Documentation

## Credits
This project was forked from *[spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar)* and completely reimagined and rewritten. <br>
The original idea is based on the status bar that was included in *[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)* before getting removed.
