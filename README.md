## Getting Started
Refer to the installation guide in the [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/setup) to get the program set up.
Once this is sorted you can start to become familiar with the syntax of sketchybar by going through the default [*sketchybarrc*](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/blob/master/sketchybarrc) file and the default [*plugin scripts*](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/blob/master/plugins),
which are located in `~/.config/sketchybar/` and look like this:

All commands and options are explained in detail in the relevant sections
of the configuration [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/bar). You can try the commands directly from
the commandline to see which affect they have and how they alter the bar. Once you have become familiar with the syntax you can
look for a config to start from [here](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47?sort=top) or start from scratch and customize
everything to your liking.
